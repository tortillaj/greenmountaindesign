## Project Overview

Power To Decide sourced their design and branding work from another agency, but needed help with the development and some final art direction. As a result, we were involved with custom programming and providing design advice for the implementation. 

We oversaw the creation of stock photography and other imagery used throughout the website. These images needed to fall in line with the tone and design provided to us.

As well, Power To Decide publishes a large volume of statistics related to teen pregnancy. This data needed to be displayed in a thoughtful, interesting way to make it easy to understand.
