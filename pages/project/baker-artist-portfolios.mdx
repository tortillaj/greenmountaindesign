## Project Overview

The Greater Baltimore Cultural Alliance (GBCA) owns and operates the new Baker Artist Portfolio website. They came with a completed design in-hand, looking for expert Drupal developers to bring it to life.

Artists in the Baltimore area can create accounts and upload their portfolio of artwork. Then, GBCA staff and other judges review all  portfolios to select winners.

As well, a robust faceted search system allows website visitors to search for particular artists or art styles.

Strict requirements from the client and coordination with a separate design firm meant clear communication and timeliness were a must.
